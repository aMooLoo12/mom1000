What you gon' do
When there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed
Is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do
When there's blood in the water?
Look me in my eyes
Tell me everything's not fine
Or the people ain't happy
And the river has run dry
You thought you could go free
But the system is done for
If you listen real closely
There's a knock at your front door
We'll never get free
Lamb to the slaughter
What you gon' do
When there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed
Is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do
When there's blood in the water?
When there's blood in the
When there's blood in the
Beg me for mercy
Admit you were toxic
You poisoned me just for
Another dollar in your pocket
Now I am the violence
I am the sickness
Won't accept your silence
Beg me for forgiveness
We'll never get free
Lamb to the slaughter
What you gon' do
When there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed
Is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do
When there's blood in the water?
When there's blood in the water
When there's blood in the
I am the people
I am the storm
I am the riot
I am the swarm"
When the last tree's fallen
The animal can't hide
Money won't solve it
What's your alibi?
What's your alibi?
What's your alibi?
What you gon' do when there's blood in the, blood in the water?
When there's blood in the water
When there's blood in the""")
